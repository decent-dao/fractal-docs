# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<details>
<summary>What is Fractal?</summary>

The Fractal framework is for on-chain DAOs to construct on-chain subDAO hierarchies in whatever structure unleashes effective and secure decision-making. This empowers your existing Safe Treasuries (by Gnosis) with the power of a truly composable governance layer, meaning DAOs can construct and scale their contributors in any hierarchy that unlocks effective execution.

For example, DAOs can formalize their contributor Multi-Sigs into subDAO hierachies all accountable to a parentDAO of community token voters. Or do you prefer a governing council of expert individuals with protection powers over a token voting community? All these structures and more are available as Fractal empowers builders to build their DAO in any structure that makes them uniquely effective. 

With different governance structures per subDAO, safeguard checks and balances at the parent level, and modular plug-and-play ecosystem additions available at each level of the DAO, this means DAOs no longer compromise on effectiveness as they scale.

<summary>What Problem does Fractal solve and how did the idea come to be?</summary>

DAOs are stuck. Stuck choosing between on-chain community decision-making (democratic but slow, expensive and tricky to tackle nuanced issues) and overly compromising on individuals executing ‘the community will’ via multi-signature. Neither is a perfect solution for everyday DAO decision-making, but DAOs shouldn’t have to choose. Why can’t DAOs be formed in a subDAO hierarchy that empowers different governance structures per working group whilst enabling on-chain safeguards to the Parent? 

The [decentDAO](https://www.decent-dao.org/) venture studio experienced this challenge firsthand as they transitioned from LLC to DAO, so they created Fractal. This novel governance framework helps DAOs who are struggling to flexibly structure their contributors’ on-chain decision-making without compromising day-to-day effectiveness. In short, Fractal empowers DAOs to get things done!

<summary>Who is Fractal for?</summary>

Fractal is for DAO members and builders who find existing DAO tools and ‘all-in-one-platforms’ rigid and restrictive for their DAO needs. As their DAO evolves and scales, they’ve seen the benefits - and at times restrictions - of different governance methods. They know there’s no such thing as ‘one governance fits all.’ They know that at times small groups of domain experts can act faster than a large community, but the community requires on-chain restrictions to protect them from losing control. 

Fractal is for the DAOs that have so far defaulted to Multi-Signatories and off-chain Snapshot voting… but know they need something more!

<details>
<summary>What is an Open Governance Framework?</summary>

A governance framework is made up of composable components which manage on-chain powers and relationships between DAO contributors.

The fact it’s ‘open’ means that this framework isn’t limited to what we build. Instead it can be built on by DAOs with the latest tooling from across the crypto ecosystem
</details>

<details>
<summary>Why did you choose to build around Safe (by Gnosis) treasuries</summary>

DAOs are governance structures for decentralized on-chain decision-making around digital assets. This requires maintaining a treasury of assets. We chose to build around Safe contract wallet (formerly Gnosis Safe) because it is the Web3 industry standard for storing treasuries of assets. Not only do 90%+ of DAOs use them but they are secure, modular and empower multiple governance options for decisions on on-chain assets.

<details>
<summary>How is Fractal composable and modular? What does this mean for my DAO?</summary>

Fractal is a small set of components and permissions attached to a Safe contract wallet.  While we provide the initial set of defaults, the Fractal framework itself is infinitely customizable.

Don’t like ERC20 token-based voting?  Your DAO can vote to remove the strategy and approve a new one.  Does your community require a childDAO to manage specific assets?  They can vote to create sub-DAOs and give custody of those assets to it. The crypto ecosystem is always expanding so your DAO from day 1 needs to be upgradeable to the latest and greatest.

<details>
<summary>What chain is Fractal built on?</summary>

Fractal is built on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), and at full launch will support Ethereum Mainnet.  Following launch, we will work to support any EVM chain where Safe is also supported.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Can I import an existing Safe treasury and governance token?</summary>

Our initial beta launch will allow for the creation of a new Safe-based Fractal DAO, along with a new governance token. By Beta-end, users will also be able to convert an existing Safe to a Fractal DAO as well as utilize an existing ERC-20 token as governance. Get involved with our Beta if you want even earlier access to these features.
</details>

<details>
<summary>What DAO is Fractal launched through?</summary>

Fractal was incubated and launched by [decentDAO](https://www.decent-dao.org/).
</details>

<details>
<summary>What functionality will there be at launch?</summary>

The Beta Launch in Q1 of 2023, will allow for the creation of subDAOs either with a (Safe) multi-sig-based governance structure, or a 1:1 ERC20 token voting structure (Usul).

Members in either structure will be able to submit transaction proposals, vote on them, and ultimately execute them, provided they pass the governance vote.

Every Parent DAOs will also have on-chain safeguard over subDAOs to also form proposals or optionally freeze the subDAO assets in case of bad actors or disagreements.

All of this will be managed in an intuitive, simple front end, designed to make managing DAO interactions easy and seamless.

<summary>What is the tech stack for Fractal?</summary>

Smart Contracts and Test Suite: solidity, openZepplin, Hardhat, Ethers

Web app: typescript, react, ethers

<summary>What are Fractal’s core benefits and competitive advantages?</summary>

1) **We’re** **Composable to any Structure** - Form a truly composable DAO as a constellation of on-chain decision-making bodies with optional checks and balances between working groups.

2) **Different Governance per working group** - Some groups require domain experts to act fast and autonomously via a Multi-Signatory. This shouldn’t mean other decisions can’t bring the diversity of the entire community to critical decisions. Pick and choose whatever suits your DAO including some of the latest in voting methodologies

3) **Set On-Chain Relationships between groups** - Keep the community in control with optional restrictions of veto, budgeting and freezing powers over smaller working groups. 

4) **A Modular & Upgradeable DAO ready to scale** - Ensure your DAO is always evolving with the latest and vetted cross-ecosystem tools and protocols; all plug-and-play. Then take this one-step further by creating your own custom integration functionality to unlock your personal favourite tools in the ecosystem

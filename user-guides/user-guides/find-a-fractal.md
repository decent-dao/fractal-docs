# Find a Fractal

## Overview

Users can easily explore example DAOs built on Fractal via the homepage. Or if they have a specific DAO in mind, they can find and interact with it from the navigation bar at the top. This also applies to any Safe (by Gnosis) multi-sig as they are all searchable directly from inside of Fractal.

## Explore DAOs built on Fractal

There's no need to connect your wallet to explore what other users have built with Fractal. Open the Fractal App homepage and go to the 'Featured DAOs' section. Click on 'Explore DAO' to check out a specific subDAO hierarchy created by our featured users from within Fractal. This includes Fractal's parent, [Decent DAO](https://www.decent-dao.org/) where our team sits as a subDAO.

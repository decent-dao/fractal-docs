# Interacting with DAOs

## Overview

The Fractal web app makes it easy to interact with any Fractal DAO. Modules make it possible to add new ways to interact with DAOs on the Fractal platform, so there is no limit to the types of interactions you can create.

The Fractal platform currently adds the Governance module to every new DAO that you create. The Governance module supports the following interactions:

* [Delegate your voting power](delegate-your-voting-power.md) - Before an address can vote, its voting power must be delegated. Delegating voting power assigns the ability to vote to a specific address. You can delegate your voting power to your own address or to another address that belongs to an individual or organization that you trust to act on your behalf.
* [Create a proposal](create-a-proposal.md) - Proposals are a way to suggest that the Fractal DAO should do something. In the case of the Governance module, when executed, proposals initiate some set of interactions between the DAO and other addresses (contracts or wallets).&#x20;

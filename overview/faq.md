# FAQ

## Background

<details>

<summary>What is Fractal</summary>

Fractal is a framework and platform that helps Web3 builders launch, fund, govern, and scale DAOs (Fractals). In the Fractal framework, a Fractal is a decentralized organization composed of a network of independent governing **Nodes**, which makes the organizing structures of Fractals infinitely adaptable.

Fractal will start as an open-source framework. Then, the Fractal DAO and governance token $FRAC will launch as the first project built on Fractal. The Fractal DAO will serve as governance for the future development of Fractal and the **Fractal Pad.**

<summary>What is a node?</summary>

Within Fractal, a new instance of a Fractal can be created. This instance is called a _**node**_. A node can create another node with some link between the two. All nodes are created equal. Each node controls a set of modules and the ability to create a new node—i.e., the ability to _**fractalize.**_

<details>

<summary>What is a subDAO?</summary>

A child DAO spawned from the parent or root DAO. Fractal’s core framework allows DAOs to exist as clusters of independent subDAOs.

</details>

<details>

<summary>What is the Fractal Pad?</summary>

The Fractal Pad is an easy way to launch an Initial Dex Offering (IDO) to raise capital for your Fractal DAOs.

The Fractal Pad is an IDO Launchpad platform for EVM-based DeFi protocols. Fractal Pad listings will be approved entirely by a decentralized consortium (the Fractal DAO) enabling users across the world to access capital at the frontier of DeFi.

<details>

<summary>What is the Fractal DAO?</summary>

The Fractal DAO is a decentralized consortium that will provide oversight and support for DAOs in the Fractal ecosystem. The Fractal DAO and the governance token $FRAC will be the first projects built in Fractal, with the goal of onboarding and growing additional projects from our community.

<details>

<summary>Why are you building Fractal?</summary>

Fractal aims to fill the need for better DAO tooling and social coordination across the Web3 space. We envision decentralized organizational structures made up of independent, but connected DAOs. To support this vision, we developed the concept of the [Minimum Viable DAO](https://mirror.xyz/decent-dao.eth/j0vupePJK2Xcpp6rt53mvcu6IfZJlGXinTz6WNgAkdI) (MVD), which serves as the basic building block for all organizations launched on Fractal. The concept of the MVD makes it possible to create extremely flexible organizational structures with all the benefits of decentralization, which is one of the major drawbacks of previous DAO platforms.

<details>

<summary>Who is Fractal for?</summary>

Fractal is meant for degens and founders in the Web3 space who want to launch their own DAO. Fractal is also for DeFi organizations looking to use DAOs to enhance the functionality of their protocols

<details>

<summary>Why will Fractal succeed?</summary>

Fractal supports our community in several unique ways that will give us a competetive advantage in the DAO-platform ecosystem:

* Fractal Pad - We provide tools and support to help newly formed DAOs with their IDO/IGO.
* Support - We help DAOs with services like payroll, bookkeeping, taxes, voting, bounty and incentive programs to improve community participation.
* Community Engagement - The organizational structures supported by Fractal enhance community engagement. Getting members to actively engage with each other is key to the health of any DAO. Members need to feel they have enough of a voice to keep contributing and participating. Fractal offers a more democratic governance model for voting to ensure that every member feels like they have a stake and a voice in the organization.
* User Experience - We provide an easy to user user interface for DAO managers and members. Our dashboard gives managers a quick view of all the contributors and what they're working on.
* Contributor Compensation - We provide tools to help DAOs compensate their contributors and track expenses. Many current DAOs are still using credit cards to pay contributors. It is difficult to transfer those payments to Gnosis Safe so having tools to help pay contributors and track expenses will be very valuable for communities as they choose which platform to launch and manage their DAO.
* Flexibility - The concept of the Minimum Viable DAO and Fractal's Node-base framework make it possible to create endless organization structures. As more DAOs are created, different DAOs will have specific nuances and needs for servicing their communities, which Fractal is uniquely positioned to support.

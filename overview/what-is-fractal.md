# What is Fractal?

Fractal is a [framework](what-is-fractal.md#fractal-framework) and a [platform](what-is-fractal.md#undefined) for launching, funding, governing, and scaling DAOs. Fractal provides the following benefits for Web3 creators:

* A framework for structuring any organization (a Fractal) as a group of independent governing bodies (Nodes).
* Modules for adding functionality to and defining governance models for Nodes, and a generic Module interface so that anyone can build new Modules.
* A shared Node architecture that enables any Module to service any Node for any Fractal or even every Node for every Fractal.

These features create a composable operating system for DAOs, which allows DAOs to outscale and outperform traditional organizations.

Fractal fills the need for better DAO tooling and social coordination across the Web3 space. Existing DAO platforms limit the functionality and structure of DAOs by making assumptions about the functions of DAOs. Fractal expands the possibilities for DAOs by providing a composable and extensible framework that supports any structure and governance model that an organization could require.

Fractal is meant for anyone working or playing in the Web3 space who wants to launch and manage their own DAO and for members of an organization who want to particpate in the administration of the DAO. Fractal is also meant for DeFi protocols looking to create DAOs for enhancing the functionality of the protocol.

## Fractal Framework

The Fractal Framework consists of Fractals, Nodes, and Modules:

* Fractal - An organization with a flexible and scalable governance model made up of Nodes. Every Fractal consists of a root Node and any number of additional Nodes.
* Node - An independent governing body with an on-chain address and contracts that control permissions. Every Node is a fully-featured DAO with the ability to create additional Nodes. All interactions between Nodes are dictated by the governance models established by the contracts associated with the Nodes. Nodes can be extended using Modules.
* Module - A standard interface for extending the functions of a Node. Modules can support functions like funding, payroll, or voting.

By building an organization from Nodes and establishing governance models using Modules, Web3 builders can create on-chain organizations that serve any purpose they can imagine. The Fractal Framework is infinitely flexible and extensible.

## Fractal Platform

The Fractal Platform provides the following functionality to make it easy for DAO creators and members to administer and participate in the operations of a DAO:

* Formation - Creating a DAO and defining the governance rules.
* Participation - Supporting and incentivizing member participation.
* User Experience - Front-end applications for participating in and managing the day-to-day activities of a DAO.

By providing tools for creating and managing DAOs, the Fractal Platform empowers the next generation of visionaries to launch transformative global movements, businesses, and social clubs harnessing the power of decentralized technology.

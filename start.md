# Connect Your Wallet

Once you've had time to explore, you can connect your wallet using any browser integration or Wallet Connect. The steps below show how to connect your MetaMask wallet:

To connect to a browser-based wallet, select it from the list. If you have not connected your wallet before, the wallet extension may open a window and prompt you to select which wallet you want to connect:

Select the correct wallet and click **Next**. The Fractal app connects to your wallet and displays your wallet address (or ENS name) in the upper right corner of the page, as shown below:

You can now use the wallet to pay gas fees for transactions with Fractal DAOs.

# Find a Fractal

## Overview

Users can easily explore example DAOs built on Fractal via the homepage. Or if they have a specific DAO in mind, they can find and interact with it from the navigation bar at the top. This also applies to any Safe (by Gnosis) multi-sig as they are all searchable directly from inside of Fractal.

## Explore DAOs built on Fractal

There's no need to connect your wallet to explore what other users have built with Fractal. Open the Fractal App homepage and go to the 'Featured DAOs' section. Click on 'Explore DAO' to check out a specific subDAO hierarchy created by our featured users from within Fractal. This includes Fractal's parent, [Decent DAO](https://www.decent-dao.org/) where our team sits as a subDAO.

## Find a Specific Fractal

In the upper left navigation bar, you will see a search box. Click inside the input.

Enter the address of the Fractal DAO that you want to interact with. If the DAO exists, it will appear in the list. Clicking **View DAO** will open the Proposals screen of the DAO dashboard. If the DAO has any associated proposals, they will be displayed:.

_Note_ - you can also search for any Safe (by Gnosis) Multi-Sig using this same method and visualize it from within Fractal.

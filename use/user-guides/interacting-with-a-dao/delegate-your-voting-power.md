# Delegate your voting power

## Overview

The Governance module uses governance tokens to allocate voting power. The more governance tokens an address holds, the more voting power it has. The voting power associated with tokens held by a wallet must be delegated before it can be used to vote, and voting power is not delegated at all by default, so you must delegate before you can vote.

You can delegate your vote to a wallet that you own, or to any wallet owned by any person or smart contract on the blockchain. When you delegate your voting power, your governance tokens are not sent to the delegate address; they stay in your wallet. Only the voting power represented by your tokens is associated with the delegate address.

## Delegate your voting power

Before delegating, launch the Fractal web app, connect your wallet, and find the Fractal that you want to interact with:

To delegate your voting power, click **Delegate** on the Fractal dashboard. The Delegate Vote screen opens:

Enter the address of the wallet or contract that will submit votes on behalf of your voting power. If you want to delegate your voting power to the wallet that is currently connected to the Fractal app, click **Self**, and it will automatically fill in the address.

Once you have entered a wallet address, click **Delegate**. Your connected wallet opens and asks you to approve the transaction:

The transaction covers the gas fees for the delegation transaction. Review the transaction and click **Confirm**. You will be returned to the Fractal app. Your wallet and the Fractal app will display notifications when the transaction is complete and your vote has been successfully delegated.

# Quick Start

To set things up, we're going to create a repository, set up the environment, and finally, create and deploy our contract.

#### 1. Clone the module repo

This module should exist in your own Github account. You do not need to submit a  PR to the Fractal team.

2\. Clone the Repository

```
// Example
git@github.com:christopherdancy/treasury-module-example.git
```

#### 2. Create Hardhat Project

If you do not have hardhat installed!

```
// If you do not have hardhat installed
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

```
// Create A hardhat project
npx hardhat
// Choose Create w/ Typescript
```

#### 3. Configure Your Dev Environment&#x20;

Set up and configure your dev environment based on the needs of your project. At a minimum, you will need to edit the following files:

* [ ] .env
* [ ] .nvmrc
* [ ] .gitignore
* [ ] tsconfig.json
* [ ] package.json
* [ ] hardhat.config.ts

See the [Fractal Treasury Module](https://github.com/decent-dao/fractal-module-treasury) repo for an example of a configured environment.

# Quick Setup

To set things up, we're going to create a repository, set up the environment, and finally, create and deploy our contract.

#### 1. Create a Github repo

This module should exist in your own Github account. You do not need to submit a  PR to the Fractal team.

2\. Clone the Repository

```
// Example
git@github.com:christopherdancy/treasury-module-example.git
```

#### 2. Create Hardhat Project

If you do not have hardhat installed!

```
// If you do not have hardhat installed
npm install --save-dev hardhat
```

```
// Create A hardhat project
npx hardhat
// Choose Create w/ Typescript
```

#### 3. Setup Dev Environment&#x20;

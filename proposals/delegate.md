  Delegate your voting power on Fractal

## Overview

Token delegation allows for a governance token holder to designate an address to vote on their behalf.

The holder maintains custody of the tokens, this *does not* transfer control of the underlying asset in any way.

## Delegate your voting power

Before delegating, connect your wallet and navigate to the Proposals page for the DAO that you want to interact with and click `Delegate`.

![](../.gitbook/assets/delegate.png)

Enter the address that will vote on your behalf. If you will be voting for yourself, click `Delegate to Self`.

Once you have entered a wallet address, click `Delegate Voting Tokens` to initiate the transaction to delegate your tokens.

You or your delegated address is now able to vote on proposals for this DAO.

Multisig DAOs do not require delegation as they do not use a token for governance.

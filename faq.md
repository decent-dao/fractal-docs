# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

<details>
<summary>What is Fractal?</summary>

Fractal is the most composable DAO app and framework. Users can form complex subDAO hierarchies and govern in whatever structure suits their needs. This extends existing Safe{Wallet}'s with no-code capabilities of multiple governance options, executive powers between subDAOs as well templating functionality to fast-track day to day operations.

As an example, an organization could form agile subDAOs - each powered by a multisig - that are accountable to a token voting community at the parent level. Or a different user could want to progressively decentralize; a small group of NFT voting members could keep some executive powers over a token voting community. All these options and more are available so that DAOs no longer feel like their locked into doing governance a certain way. Your DAO. Your Way!

<summary>What Problem does Fractal solve and how did the idea come to be?</summary>

DAOs are stuck. There are an infinite number of possibilities available to DAOs but current organizations aren't agile or open enough to take advantage. Moving on-chain feels like giving up their agility, scalability and community experimentation. They have to pick one governance for their entire DAO. They lack the technical bandwidth to compose complicated subDAO structures and wish it could be as no-code as drag and drop.

The [Decent DAO](https://www.decent-dao.org/) venture studio experienced this challenge firsthand as they transitioned to becoming a DAO, so together we created Fractal.

<summary>Who is Fractal for?</summary>

Fractal is for those who find existing DAO tools rigid and restrictive. These people know there’s rarely such thing as ‘one governance fits all’ so regularly just use a Safe{Wallet} multisig and Snapshot vote for now. They might have tip-toed around the idea of moving on-chain in a subDAO structure.... but fear getting locked-in to one provider or diverting their own engineers to tackle the probelm. 

Here, Fractal offers value across multiple DAO stakeholders:

* **DAO Leaders and Founders** - Create your own on-chain subDAO hierarchies. Establish the structure, permissions and governance unique to your DAO. Offer your contributors as much - or as little - decision making power on assets as you feel comfortable with. Ensure whatever structure you go for, that it's all transparent, scalable and on-chain to build community confidence. Never feel locked-in as at the end of the day, each subDAO is just a Safe{Wallet} multisig.
* **DAO Community Members**  - Track all DAO activities and asset movements. Engage on proposals based on permissions. Let contributor subDAOs action daily tasks whilst you review - and potentially freeze - activities that may go against your wishes
* **DAO Contributors** - Get clarity on what budgets and assets you've been allocated. Action your responsibilities with on-chain buy-in from the community. Speed up regular DAO tasks with a template builder that interoperates no-code with any smart contract on Ethereum to access all the benefits DeFi offers your organization.

<summary>Why did you choose to build around Safe{Wallet} (by Gnosis)</summary>

DAOs essentially just add custom decision making powers to digital assets. This requires a huge amount of trust that the treasury will hold these assets securely. We chose to build around Safe{Wallet} multisig (formerly Gnosis Safe) because it is the industry standard for storing assets. As well as this, 90%+ of DAOs already use a Safe, meaning getting started with Fractal is as easy as searching for your Safe's address in our nav bar. Users never have to feel locked-in to a DAO tool again as Safes are built end to end to be custom and modular (see below).

<summary>How is Fractal composable and modular? What does this mean for my DAO?</summary>

Fractal is a small set of components and permissions attached to a Safe{Wallet} multisig.  While we provide the initial set of defaults, the Fractal framework itself is infinitely customizable.

Don’t like ERC-20 token-based voting?  Your DAO can vote to remove the strategy and approve a new one. The crypto ecosystem is always expanding so your DAO from day 1 needs to be upgradeable to the latest and greatest.

<details>
<summary>What chain is Fractal built on?</summary>

Fractal is built on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). At launch we will support Ethereum Mainnet but will support Polygon very soon.

<details>
<summary>Can I import an existing Safe{Wallet} treasury and governance token?</summary>

Yes, absolutely. We want to make starting with Fractal as easy for existing DAOs as possible. If you don't have either though, you can also start from scratch at the click of a button.

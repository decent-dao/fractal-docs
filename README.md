# Welcome to Fractal

The components of the Fractal Framework support the creation of a composable operating system for DAOs, which allows DAOs to outscale and outperform traditional organizations. Fractal provides tools to support everyone from DAO members to Web3 developers:

* Developers - Build modules to extend the functionality of DAOs and develop new front end user experiences.
* DAO Organizers - Create on chain DAOs and establish their governance models.
* DAO Participants - Interact with DAOs, depending on the structure created by the organizers.
* DeFi protocols - Use DAOs to support sophisticated workflows and scale up your DeFi protocol.

This site includes the following documentation:

* [Build ](the-core-framework/developer-overview.md)- An overview of the Fractal Protocol, developer guides, and contract references.
* [Use ](broken-reference)- Guides for using the Fractal web app to deploy, manage, and participate in DAOs.

## Why Fractal?

Fractal fills the need for better DAO tooling and social coordination across the Web3 space. Existing DAO platforms limit the functionality and structure of DAOs by making assumptions about the functions of DAOs. Fractal expands the possibilities for DAOs by providing a composable and extensible framework that supports any structure and governance model that an organization could require.

### Benefits

The Fractal Framework has several benefits over traditional DAO implementations:

* Flexible - A framework for structuring any organization (a Fractal) as a group of independent governing bodies (Nodes).
* Extensible - Modules extend the capabilities of Nodes by implementing specific business requirements that a DAO may have, such as treasury management and governance.
* Interoperable and Upgradable - A shared Node architecture that enables any Module to service any Node for any Fractal or even every Node for every Fractal.

### Features

To ensure that DAO participants and Web3 developers can take full advantage of Fractal's capabilities, the following resources exist:

* NPM package - For module developers who want to extend the functionality of Fractal DAOs, the NPM package adds the MVD integration to your project.
* Module interfaces - Interface contracts that define and enforce the Fractal architecture, ensuring that all Nodes and Modules work together seamlessly.
* Modules - DAO features, like voting and governance, that you can use directly or extend to meet your needs.
* Plugins - React code which makes the crafting transactions a breeze for the user. Regardless if they are connecting with the community by interacting with fractal modules or unlocking their inner Degen with Luna options, its just one click away.

## The Fractal Framework

The Fractal Framework is built around the idea of a minimum viable DAO (MVD) that can be extended by modules. Conceptually, it defines DAOs in terms of Fractals, Nodes, and Modules:

* Fractal - An organization with a flexible and scalable governance model made up of Nodes. Every Fractal consists of a root Node and any number of additional Nodes.
* Node - An independent governing body with an on-chain address and contracts that control permissions. Every Node is a fully-featured DAO with the ability to create additional Nodes. All interactions between Nodes are dictated by the governance models established by the contracts associated with the Nodes. Nodes can be extended using Modules.
* Module - A standard interface for extending the functions of a Node. Modules can support functions like funding, payroll, or voting.

By building an organization from Nodes and establishing governance models using Modules, Web3 builders can create on-chain organizations that serve any purpose they can imagine. The Fractal Framework is infinitely flexible and extensible.

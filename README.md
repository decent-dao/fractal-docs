# Fractal

Fractal let's you do more with DAO's. The Fractal Platform includes a web app and developer resources to support everyone from DAO members to Web3 developers:

* Web app - DAO participants can create and launch DAOs, mint governance tokens, and submit and vote on proposals.
* Developer resources - Web3 builders can use our open source code and NPM package to launch and extend the capabilities of DAOs and build front-end user experiences for interacting with DAOs.

The components of the Fractal Platform support the creation of a composable operating system for DAOs, which allows DAOs to outscale and outperform traditional organizations. Fractal empowers the next generation of visionaries to launch transformative global movements, businesses, and social clubs harnessing the power of decentralized technology.

## Why Fractal?

Fractal fills the need for better DAO tooling and social coordination across the Web3 space. Existing DAO platforms limit the functionality and structure of DAOs by making assumptions about the functions of DAOs. Fractal expands the possibilities for DAOs by providing a composable and extensible framework that supports any structure and governance model that an organization could require.

### Benefits

The Fractal Framework has several benefits over traditional DAO implementations:

* Flexible - A framework for structuring any organization (a Fractal) as a group of independent governing bodies (Nodes).
* Extensible - Modules that extend the capabilities of Nodes and a generic Module interface so that anyone can build new Modules.
* Interoperable and Upgradable - A shared Node architecture that enables any Module to service any Node for any Fractal or even every Node for every Fractal.

### Support

To ensure that DAO participants and Web3 developers can take full advantage of Fractal's capabilities, we provide the following resources:

* NPM package - Adds the Fractal base contracts to your project so that you can use them to launch DAOs directly or as the backend for your UI.
* Module interfaces - Interface contracts that define and enforce the Fractal architecture, ensuring that all Nodes and Modules work together seamlessly.
* Plugins / recipes - Standard modules, like voting and governance, that you can use directly or extend to meet your needs.

## Who is Fractal for?

Fractal is meant for anyone working or building in the Web3 space who wants to create or use DAOs:

* DAO participants - Create, launch, manage, and interact with DAOs.
* Web3 developers - Extend the capabilities of Fractal DAOs and enhance the front-end user experience of your DAOs.
* DeFi protocols - Use DAOs to support sophisticated workflows and scale up your DeFi protocol.

## What is Fractal?

Fractal is a [framework](./#fractal-framework) and a [platform](./#undefined) for launching, funding, governing, and scaling DAOs.

### Fractal Framework

The Fractal Framework is built around the idea of a minimum viable DAO (MVD) that can be extended by modules. Conceptually, it defines DAOs in terms of Fractals, Nodes, and Modules:

* Fractal - An organization with a flexible and scalable governance model made up of Nodes. Every Fractal consists of a root Node and any number of additional Nodes.
* Node - An independent governing body with an on-chain address and contracts that control permissions. Every Node is a fully-featured DAO with the ability to create additional Nodes. All interactions between Nodes are dictated by the governance models established by the contracts associated with the Nodes. Nodes can be extended using Modules.
* Module - A standard interface for extending the functions of a Node. Modules can support functions like funding, payroll, or voting.

By building an organization from Nodes and establishing governance models using Modules, Web3 builders can create on-chain organizations that serve any purpose they can imagine. The Fractal Framework is infinitely flexible and extensible.

### Fractal Platform

The Fractal Platform provides tools that make it easy for DAO creators and members to administer and participate in the operations of a DAO:

* Formation - Creating a DAO and defining the governance rules.
* Participation - Supporting and incentivizing member participation.
* User Experience - Front-end applications for participating in and managing the day-to-day activities of a DAO.

Fractal's tools for creating and managing DAOs, provide straightforward ways for creators to harness the power of DAOs.
